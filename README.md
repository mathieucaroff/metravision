# Metravision

Detecting and counting light vehicles (motorbikes and alikes) on highways,
using video processing.

## Installing

### Basic use

The project depends on anaconda packages. To retrieve them, you should install
miniconda or anaconda, then install them, using:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge opencv pyyaml ipython
conda install -c anaconda python-daemon
```

If you are on Windows, these commands should be copied to the "Anaconda Prompt"
window.

### Developement environnement

This project used Pylint to perform basic quality checking on the code.
Rope was used to perform refactoring tasks.

If you want to develop the project, you may want to install the python packages
`pylint` and `rope`. You can do so with the command:

```sh
conda install pylint rope
```

### Pyinstaller

We packed the metravision launcher using pyInstaller. PyInstaller can be
installed using pip:

```sh
conda install pip
pip install pyinstaller
```

## "Compiling" (packing) the metravision launcher using pyInstaller

Once pyInstaller is installed, launch-metravision.py can be packed by running
the below command from the folder which contains `launch-metravision.py`.

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile launch-metravision.py
```

The target .exe will be placed into a directory named `dist`. It's been made to
be used from either inside the repository, or one directory up, provided the
repository is named `metravision`. All the other files generated by pyInstaller
can be removed.
If I'm correct, thoses files are:
`dist/`, `build/*` `__pycache__/*`, `launch-metravision.spec`

This can be done in a single command from Anaconda:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile launch-metravision.py && move /y ist\\launch-metravision.exe .. && del /q dist && del /q build && del /q launch-metravision.spec
```

## Using git

Below is the subset of the most basic git commands you need to know to work
on a git project.

To get a more robust presentation of git basics, you might want to read the
page [Learn git in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/git/).
The below command presentations are copy-pasted from that page. Though shorter,
this page will likely be harder to understand than the above linked page.

### Détail des commandes

#### config

To configure settings. Whether it be for the repository, the system itself,
or global configurations ( global config file is `~/.gitconfig` ).

```bash
# Print & Set Some Basic Config Variables (Global)
$ git config --global user.email "MyEmail@Zoho.com"
$ git config --global user.name "My Name"
```

[Learn More About git config.](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)

#### help

To give you quick access to an extremely detailed guide of each command. Or to
just give you a quick reminder of some semantics.

```bash
# Quickly check available commands
$ git help

# Check all available commands
$ git help -a

# Command specific help - user manual
# git help <command_here>
$ git help add
$ git help commit
$ git help init
# or git <command_here> --help
$ git add --help
$ git commit --help
$ git init --help
```

#### clone

Clones, or copies, an existing repository into a new directory. It also adds
remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repo, which allows you
to push to a remote branch.

```bash
# Clone learnxinyminutes-docs
$ git clone https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs.git

# shallow clone - faster cloning that pulls only latest snapshot
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs.git

# clone only a specific branch
$ git clone -b master-cn https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs.git --single-branch
```

#### status

To show differences between the index file (basically your working copy/repo)
and the current HEAD commit.

```bash
# Will display the branch, untracked files, changes and other differences
$ git status

# To learn other "tid bits" about git status
$ git help status
```

#### add

To add files to the staging area/index. If you do not `git add` new files to
the staging area/index, they will not be included in commits!

```bash
# add a file in your current working directory
$ git add HelloWorld.java

# add a file in a nested dir
$ git add /path/to/file/HelloWorld.c

# Regular Expression support!
$ git add ./*.java

# You can also add everything in your working directory to the staging area.
$ git add -A
```

This only adds a file to the staging area/index, it doesn't commit it to the
working directory/repo.

#### commit

Stores the current contents of the index in a new "commit." This commit
contains the changes made and a message created by the user.

```bash
# commit with a message
$ git commit -m "Added multiplyNumbers() function to HelloWorld.c"

# signed commit with a message (user.signingkey must have been set
# with your GPG key e.g. git config --global user.signingkey 5173AAD5)
$ git commit -S -m "signed commit message"

# automatically stage modified or deleted files, except new files, and then commit
$ git commit -a -m "Modified foo.php and removed bar.php"

# change last commit (this deletes previous commit with a fresh commit)
$ git commit --amend -m "Correct message"
```

#### log

Display commits to the repository.

```bash
# Show all commits
$ git log

# Show only commit message & ref
$ git log --oneline

# Show merge commits only
$ git log --merges

# Show all commits represented by an ASCII graph
$ git log --graph
```

#### pull

Pulls from a repository and merges it with another branch.

```bash
# Update your local repo, by merging in new changes
# from the remote "origin" and "master" branch.
# git pull <remote> <branch>
$ git pull origin master

# By default, git pull will update your current branch
# by merging in new changes from its remote-tracking branch
$ git pull

# Merge in changes from remote branch and rebase
# branch commits onto your local repo, like: "git fetch <remote> <branch>, git
# rebase <remote>/<branch>"
$ git pull origin master --rebase
```

#### push

Push and merge changes from a branch to a remote & branch.

```bash
# Push and merge changes from a local repo to a
# remote named "origin" and "master" branch.
# git push <remote> <branch>
$ git push origin master

# By default, git push will push and merge changes from
# the current branch to its remote-tracking branch
$ git push

# To link up current local branch with a remote branch, add -u flag:
$ git push -u origin master
# Now, anytime you want to push from that same local branch, use shortcut:
$ git push
```
